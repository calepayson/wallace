# You Don't Matter

Yes, you. 

You don't matter. 

I mean, you're filled with meaning.

You inject meaning into every moment of your existence.

Every instance of your experience seems suffused with significance.

But, in the eyes of the universe?

You don't matter.

This isn't a rant about how life is meaningless.

It seems very meaningful to me.

But, you and I? We don't matter.

You and I are farts in the cosmic wind. Our specific combination of molecules will never be repeated. 

Your kids will be half like you. Theirs, a quarter like you. 

At that rate, the universe's memory of you blinks out quite quickly. 

How much do you know about your great-great-grandparents?

But our genes matter.

Some of our genes haven't changed in millenia. Their specific combination of molecules has been repeated for billions of years. Has *survived* for billions of years.

Genes matter.

This is the mistake that we all make when we first learn about evolution.

We hear "survival of the fittest" and assume that we're the star of the show. We assume that species are the stars of the show. 

But we last for ~120 years at best!

Then we die. 

We don't survive. 

But genes do.

Your BRCA2 gene can be inherited until the end of the species.

So far, it has been.

When you think of evolution, keep the gene in mind.

Remind yourself, "I don't matter".

Survival of the fittest doesn't play out in forests between individuals, or predators and prey.

Survival of the fittest happens between individual genes. 

You are to genes as a murmuration is to starlings.

A fleeting amalgamation, never to be repeated.

You may be interesting, but you do not matter.
